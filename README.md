# Predicting-Solar-Power
Shell-Edunet AICTE Internship on Predicting Solar Power Output using Linear Regression.

  #  Week-1
          The project is Prediction of Solar Power Output 
          using Linear Regression and in week-1 the tasks 
          like importing libraries, loading the dataset, 
          checking the information, and plot distribution
          of power using histplot .     
 
  # Week-2
          The project is Prediction of Solar Power Output 
          using Linear Regression and in week-2 the topics
          covered are Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
          histograms, scatterplots, bivariate analysis, 
          correlation, heatmap, and outliers using boxplot.
  # Week-3
          In the week-3 we have build the machine learning 
          model using scikit learn. The data is splitted into 
          features and targets. The data is splitted into train
          and test sets. Training the linear regression  model
          and evaluated.
